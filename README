Project description
	The "HZSK Help Center" is a one-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application.
	It provides a FAQ-style information base for users of the HZSK Repository (https://corpora.uni-hamburg.de/repository).

	The contents of the help pages are multlingual (currently German and English). 
	Switching between languages is facilitated by a simple JavaScript mechanism.
	The mechanism (clicking on language flags) triggers a change of the lang-attribute of the HTML body element which in turn results in a change of the display of elements marked with corresponding lang-attributes themselves.
	The display of elements with specified lang-attributes is mostly controlled by the CSS declarations, which for instance hide elements *[@lang='de'] inside a body[@lang='en'] and vice versa.

	The general structure and dynamic appearance (tabs and accordion views) are controlled by Bootstrap CSS.
